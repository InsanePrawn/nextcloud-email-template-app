# email_template_example
✉️ Example E-Mail Template for Nextcloud


# Notes from the git uploader

Example App showing how to ship an overriden `EmailTemplate` class as an App.

This example was salvaged from the now [fully paywalled Nextcloud Enterpise Portal](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/customized-email-templates-29.html)
as a ZIP file and then imported into git.

## Personal Ramble

I'm quite annoyed at having to go and find alternative ways to acquire this ZIP,
as almost every discussion of the topic of customizing email templates (ever
since NC11 (2016) changed to this class-based aproach) seems to link the
paywalled article, probably due to company policy.  
(Apparently the ZIP download was freely available
there until recently.)  
Even a link titled "a Github issue" in the relevant open docs section baits you
into opening one more tab of their paywall grinning at you.

I'd much rather have spent time on fixing actual Nextcloud bugs than chasing
down this example and trying out the App "skeleton" generator just to find
that it generates a notes app instead of an actual minimal app skeleton.

I was here to fix a problem with mails, not learn how to write Nextcloud Apps
or fight with paywalls.

Sigh.

I'm glad this is AGPL-licensed.
May this code be properly in the public domain from now.
